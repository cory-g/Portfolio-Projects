# GUI Version - Website Contest Voting Automation  

### Fourleaf (Bethpage) Federal Credit Union runs a marketing campaign where people can vote for the "Best of Long Island" in every industry imaginable. 

### After checking the terms of service, there are no limits regarding the number of times a person can vote. There are also no rules stating automation is against the rules.  

### I wanted to give a little public recognition to a local Doctor that goes above and beyond in every sense, and deserves to have her name among the candidates for best Pediatrician on Long Island!
