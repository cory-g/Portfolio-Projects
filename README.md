## About Me
My name is **Cory Gargan** and I would like to thank you for stopping by.  
I'm just a guy who enjoys digging into data in search of what's really happening!  
I am also a dog lover, avid mycologist & cacti propagator.

## What do we have here?
I have created this repo as a place to showcase some of the work I have done with SQL, R, Python, and Tableau.
