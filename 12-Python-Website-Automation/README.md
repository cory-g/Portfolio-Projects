## Website Contest Voting Automation

### This Python script is a project written for anyone local to New York, specifically Long Island. Bethpage Federal Credit Union runs a marketing campaign where people can vote for the "Best of Long Island" in every industry imaginable.  

### After checking the terms of service, there are no limits regarding the number of times a person can vote. There are also no rules stating automation is against the rules.  

### I wanted to help give a little public recognition to a local Doctor that goes above and beyond in every sense and deserves to have her name among the candidates for best Pediatrician on Long Island!  

### I wrote this web automation script to keep my hands from cramping while allowing my votes to be registered.  

### For my purposes the script is set to automatically begin voting once run  
 
### I am happy with how this came out!
